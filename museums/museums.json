Housing the largest motorcycle collection in the United States with more than 1,600 motorcycles and racing cars that date from the early 1900s to modern day. The museum began as the private collection of George W. Barber, a former racecar driver. Barber first opened a museum in 1995, but relocated to this larger facility in 2003.",
